I have served on active duty in the U.S. Army for the last 19 years and am currently stationed in Europe.  When I'm not working or doing schoolwork, I enjoy travelling and sightseeing with my family.  I am nearing retirement from active duty and looking forward to starting a new career in the civilian sector.
