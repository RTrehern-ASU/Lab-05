I have spent the last 19 years in the U.S. Army and am currently stationed in Europe.  When I'm not working or doing schoolwork, I enjoy travelling and sightseeing with my family.  I'm nearing retirement from the Army and looking forward to starting a new career in the civilian sector sometime in the next couple of years.
